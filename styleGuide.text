Roc Project Style Guide
=======================


General
-------

* Lines wrapped at 72 characters (per Python).
* Two spaces between sentences.  (Easier to read in fixed-width text and
  Emacs default.  Also less ambiguous.)
* Two empty lines between sections.
* Abbreviations treated like words with respect to capitalization
  etc. in identifiers, code, file names, etc. (contrary to Java style).
  For example, "Http", "Xml", "Csv".  Abbreviations regular in other
  text (e.g. documentation).
* Punctuation outside or inside quotation marks?  Traditional style:
  latter; my programming eyes: former.
* Otherwise standard per-language style unless noted


Pandoc / Markdown
-----------------

* Pandoc extensions where appropriate.
* Emacs [Markdown mode](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/).
* Emacs Pandoc mode?
* ".text" extension. (?)  (I'm not necessarily a fan but that is what
  the Markdown dude does.)
* Newline after heading.  Two after title.
* Two spaces between table columns (if using spaces)
* Do hanging indents, no "lazy" styles
* Indent nested list items to text indent
  * Like so
