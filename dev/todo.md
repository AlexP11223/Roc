Agenda and Issues
=================


These are initial thoughts.  We may switch this over to Github issue
tracking or keep this for higher-level (agenda) items and track bugs on
Github.  (It may be nice to not depend on Github, however.)

The todos listed below (except perhaps for basic tests and scenarios
which is so broad) fit much better within the issue tracker I
think. Issue tracker supports comments and discussion much better and
provides cleaner archiving of completed todos.

TODO
----

Priority queue; move the important items to the top.

* build system!  (people won't contribute if they can't build the
  software)
* Design API, including names.  Note language-specific things.
* basic tests and scenarios


Bugs
----

None!
