Agenda and Issues
=================


These are initial thoughts.  We may switch this over to Github issue
tracking or keep this for higher-level (agenda) items and track bugs on
Github.  (It may be nice to not depend on Github, however.)


TODO
----

Priority queue; move the important items to the top.

* build system!  (people won't contribute if they can't build the
  software)
* Design API, including names.  Note language-specific things.
* basic tests and scenarios


Bugs
----

None!
