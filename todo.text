Agenda and Issues
=================


These are initial thoughts.  We may switch this over to Github issue
tracking or keep this for higher-level (agenda) items and track bugs on
Github.  (It may be nice to not depend on Github, however.)

Priority queue; move the important items to the top.

* Github setup
* project development layout
  * directory for development documentation, meta, etc.?
* flesh out and revise readme
