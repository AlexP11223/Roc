Wondering what's around here?  Here's what.


Directories
-----------

* `java`: Everything for Java: source code, tests, internal
  documentation, etc.

  * `src`: Tree of sources for library and program under `mloss/roc`,
    some files for producing Javadoc.

    * `doc-files`: Files for including in the Javadoc.  Currently, all
      these files are generated and so this directory can be safely
      removed.

  Language-specific documentation is in the respective language
